        'Boyerâ€“Moore algorithm uses information gathered during the 
         preprocess step to skip sections of the text, resulting in a
         lower constant factor than many other string search algorithms.
         In general, the algorithm runs faster as the pattern length 
         increases. The key features of the algorithm are to match on 
         the tail of the pattern rather than the head, and to skip along
         the text in jumps of multiple characters rather than searching
         every single character in the text.'
